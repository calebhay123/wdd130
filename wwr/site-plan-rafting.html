    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to make our company more easily accessable. The way the world is moving, we need to offer the ability
        to sign up for our services online, which will surely have an impact on our revenue. We also need to have a presence online for our company to grow, and having our own website is the best way to do it.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our target audience is college aged students. They are the people most likely to sign up for our services, and as such we need to cater
        this website to them. One of our primary focuses should be ensuring that the site is responsive, so it can be easily viewed on any screen, be it a laptop
        or a mobile phone, as our target audience will be visiting our site on many different devices. We will also make it easy for them to make group
        appointments, as they will likely want to involve their friends. In terms of the design of the site, we will use colors found in nature since that is more
        appealing to those who would be interested in our services. We will also focus the images of our site to be of those having fun with friends, so as to help
        encourage them to bring friends.
