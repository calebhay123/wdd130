            Hi! I'm Caleb this is my first semester at BYU Idaho. I'm majoring in Biology with an emphasis in 
            Neuroscience, with the goal of going into med school. I am taking this course as one of my elective's, as I've taken a couple web design classes
            from a trade school while in highschool and I wanted to see the difference between that and a college course. I also love working with computers and different types of technology and plan to 
            go into either engineering or software design if my current plans change.
            </p>

                I've been a member of The Church for my whole life, and recently returned from my mission, starting in Alabama and Florida
                for a year and finishing as a service missionary, where I worked for the Church's Global Services Department helping in web feedback.

            A couple of hobbies of mine include 3d printing 
            and prop making, 3d modeling, hiking, repelling, camping, skiing, reading, and learning new skills.
            A personal goal I have for myself is to learn as many things that interest me as I can (another reason why I'm taking this class!)
