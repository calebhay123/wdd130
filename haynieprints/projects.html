                        <p>This one is a particular favorite of mine, it was super simple to print and was an absolute blast to paint and weather! The only issue I’ve run into, is that the design is a bit fragile, but since it’s meant for display rather than swinging around, it makes a lot of sense!</p>

                        <p>I printed this more as an experiment than anything, trying to see if I could make a paddle out of PLA+ (which I can use on any printer) instead of ABS (Which I need a heated enclosure for). The paddle definitely works and there’s a lot of potential in printing them, however since I printed it out of PLA+ it’s not very heat resistant, so it has a little bend. I’m planning on trying to make more of these with my own design and testing different filaments, but that will be later down the line.</p>

                        <p>The project I’m most proud of! I was able to fully 3d print and paint a set of 501st clone officer armor. This took over a year of printing tests to see if it fit, fitting pieces together, applying different fillers and sanding them down, making straps and harnesses so it would stay on and painting, but in the end it was worth it!</p>

                        <h3>Modular Lego Minifigure Display</h3>
                        <p>This was the first project where I've designed the actual files myself! I found that I had a lot of minifigures that I wanted to display, but didn't really have a good way to, so I learned how to use Fusion 360 and made these individual 'cells' that fit together to make a display as big as you'd like!</p>
                        <p>I haven't published these files online yet, but I plan to in the future.</p>
