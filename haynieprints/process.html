                <p>Here are the different methods I use to make my projects, these are mostly a brief overview rather than an actual guide, for that I recommend researching the topic on youtube, as that’s where I learned all of this</p>

                        <h3>Fitting Pieces Together</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes your eyes are bigger than your printer, which usually results in you needing to find some way to make the many different pieces you printed fit together! I use two different methods for this. The first is glue/epoxy, if you have a piece that may be put under a bit of strain, such as a helmet, I’ll typically use a two part epoxy to hold them together, however this takes a bit of time for the epoxy to set. If the piece is for decoration, I’ll typically use super glue, since it’s much quicker and gets the job done. The second method I use is kinda like plastic welding. I’l super glue the parts together to hold them in place, then I’ll take a soldering iron and mix the plastic of the pieces together, essentially making it one piece. This method takes less time then using epoxy and creates a pretty stable bond, however it does emit some pretty nasty fumes, as well as leaves a welded look on the print, so I typically use it if there’s an area that I can sand down, or that won’t be seen.</p>

                        <h3>Sanding</h3>
                        <p>The next issue you’ll typically run into is that you can easily see the layer lines of the print, as well the spots where you glued/welded it together. I usually tackle this issue with two steps, putty and primer. I’ll first use a sandable putty, like bondo or wood filler and put it over the worst areas, like the top of domes and where two pieces came together, let it dry then sand, then repeat and keep repeating until it’s smooth or you’re tired of sanding. Then I’ll wash off the dust and spray it with a sandable filler primer, sand, spray more, sand, until it’s smooth.</p>

                        <h3>Painting</h3>
                        <p>This is the funnest part, what I typically do is I use spray paint for my projects, since I can’t seem to get the hang of using an airbrush. I’ll usually do a base coat of whatever the main color I want it to be, then tape it off so I’ll only paint the sections where I want a different color to be. The most difficult part of this is when you want to paint patterns, as it requires a lot of adjusting tape to make it work. You can also try and find a stencil that you can print online to use to make it easier.</p>

                        <h3>Weathering</h3>
                        <p>This step is where I'll make the project I finished look more realistic, since before it looks all shiny and new. The first part of this actually takes place during the painting stage, where I'll put some latex tape over the areas I'm painting so it looks like the paint has started to chip away. After I finish painting I'll peel away the latex tape to show off the effect. I'll then take a mixture of water and black paint and brush it over the object, letting it sit for a few seconds, then wiping it off with a paper towel, leaving just a bit of paint left over. The result is that it looks like a layer of grime has settled into the object, giving it a much more realistic look. Please note that this step is unnecassary if you want the object to look shiny. I personally prefer doing it this way, as the weathering tends to hide any mistakes I made in the earlier steps.</p>
